## Add a hit counter to our stack

Okay, our hit counter is ready. Let's use it in our app. Open `bin/cdk-workshop.ts` and add:

{{<highlight ts "hl_lines=4 16-18 22">}}
import cdk = require('@aws-cdk/cdk');
import lambda = require('@aws-cdk/aws-lambda');
import apigw = require('@aws-cdk/aws-apigateway');
import { HitCounter } from './hitcounter';

class CdkWorkshopStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(parent: cdk.App, name: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(parent, name, props);

    const hello = new lambda.Function(this, 'HelloHandler', {
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NodeJS810,
      code: lambda.Code.directory('lambda'),
      handler: 'hello.handler'
    });

    const helloWithCounter = new HitCounter(this, 'HelloHitCounter', {
      downstream: hello
    });

    // defines an API Gateway REST API resource backed by our "hello" function.
    new apigw.LambdaRestApi(this, 'Endpoint', {
      handler: helloWithCounter.handler
    });
  }
}

const app = new cdk.App();
new CdkWorkshopStack(app, 'CdkWorkshopStack');
app.run();
{{</highlight>}}

Notice that we changed our REST API handler to use `helloWithCounter.handler`
instead of `hello`. This basically means that whenever our endpoint is hit, API
Gateway will route the request to our hit counter handler, which will log the
hit and proxy it over to the `hello` function.

## Deploy

```s
$ cdk deploy
...doing the magic...
CdkWorkshopStack.Endpoint8024A810 = https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/
```

## Test

Okay, ready to give this a go? (you should, again, see the URL of your API in
the output of the "deploy" command)

```s
$ curl -i https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/
HTTP/1.1 502 Bad Gateway
```

Oh no... seems like something went wrong. Let's see how to find out and fix it.
