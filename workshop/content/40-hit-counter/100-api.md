Create a new file under `bin` called `hitcounter.ts` with the following content:

```ts
import cdk = require('@aws-cdk/cdk');
import lambda = require('@aws-cdk/aws-lambda');

export interface HitCounterProps {
  /** the function for which we want to count url hits **/
  downstream: lambda.FunctionRef;
}

export class HitCounter extends cdk.Construct {
  constructor(parent: cdk.Construct, id: string, props: HitCounterProps) {
    super(parent, id);


  }
}
```

* We declared a new construct class called `HitCounter`.
* As usual, constructor arguments are `parent`, `id` and `props`, and we
  propagate them to `super` (`cdk.Construct` in this case).
* The `props` argument is of type `HitCounterProps` which includes a single
  property `downstream` of type `lambda.Function`. This is where we are going to "plug in" the
  Lambda function we created in the previous chapter so it can be hit-counted.

Notice that we are not mentioning DynamoDB here at all. This is because the fact
that the hit counter uses DynamoDB as storage is part of it's implementation
details. We follow the encapsulation principal of object-oriented design.
