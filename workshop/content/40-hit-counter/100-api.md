## Create a new file for our hit counter construct

Create a new file under `bin` called `hitcounter.ts` with the following content:

```ts
import cdk = require('@aws-cdk/cdk');
import lambda = require('@aws-cdk/aws-lambda');

export interface HitCounterProps {
  /** the function for which we want to count url hits **/
  downstream: lambda.Function;
}

export class HitCounter extends cdk.Construct {
  constructor(parent: cdk.Construct, id: string, props: HitCounterProps) {
    super(parent, id);

    // TODO
  }
}
```

## What's going on here?

* We declared a new construct class called `HitCounter`.
* As usual, constructor arguments are `parent`, `id` and `props`, and we
  propagate them to the `cdk.Construct` base class.
* The `props` argument is of type `HitCounterProps` which includes a single
  property `downstream` of type `lambda.Function`. This is where we are going to "plug in" the
  Lambda function we created in the previous chapter so it can be hit-counted.

Next, are are going to write the handler code of our hit counter.
