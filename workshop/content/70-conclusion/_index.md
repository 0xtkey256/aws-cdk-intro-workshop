# Congratulations!

You've successfully finished our __Introduction to the CDK__ workshop!

In this workshop, you've learned how to:

- Create a new CDK project in TypeScript using `cdk init`
- Add resources to your CDK application stack
- Use `cdk diff` and `cdk deploy` to deploy your app to an AWS environment
- Author and use your own custom construct (`HitCounter`)
- Consume a construct from another npm module (`cdk-dynamo-table-viewer`)
- Use the AWS Lambda, API Gateway and DynamoDB AWS construct libraries

## What's next?

The AWS CDK is a work in progress. It is currently in Developer Preview. We'd
love to hear what you think about every aspect of the framework.

Here are a few things you can do from here:

* __Build something__: build something real with the CDK and let us know how it
  went. What worked? What was intuitive? What was completely misleading?
* __Publish construct libraries__: start thinking about infrastructure in terms
  of small reusable modules instead of monolithic templates. Pick up a useful
  thing you've built and try to design a beautiful API for it. Share it with the
  community and let us know about it. We'll be curating a list of constructs,
  and would love to list yours.
* [Get started](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/getting-started.html) with the
  CDK in one of the supported languages: Java, .NET, JavaScript and TypeScript
* Dive deeper into [CDK
  Concepts](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/concepts.html):
  [Constructs](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/constructs.html),
  [Stacks](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/stacks.html),
  [Logical IDs](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/logical-ids.html),
  [Environments](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/environments.html),
  [Apps](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/apps.html),
  [Passing in Values](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/passing-in-data.html),
  [Environmental Context](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/context.html),
  [Assets](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/assets.html),
  [Applets](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/applets.html)
* Explore the [AWS Construct
  Library](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/aws-construct-lib.html) and the
  [reference documentation](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/reference.html)
  which already contains constructs for many AWS resources such as
  [EC2](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_aws-ec2.html),
  [AutoScaling](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_aws-autoscaling.html),
  [S3](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_aws-s3.html),
  [SNS](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_aws-sns.html),
  [SQS](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_aws-sqs.html),
  [CodePipeline](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_aws-codepipeline.html),
  [Step Functions](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/refs/_aws-cdk_aws-stepfunctions.html)
  and many more...
* Read guidelines on how to [write your own
  constructs](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cdk/writing-constructs.html)
* Learn about [__jsii__](https://github.com/awslabs/jsii), the technology
  behind the CDK's multi-language support
* Browse some [examples](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cdk/tree/master/examples) on our GitHub repository
