# Welcome Developers!

__Oh, hey there!__

Thanks for joining us! Hope you can't wait to play a little bit with this new
thing we call the "AWS Cloud Development Kit" or in short, the AWS CDK.

The AWS CDK is a new software development framework from AWS with the sole
purpose of making it is fun and easy to define cloud infrastructure in your
favorite programming language and deploy it using AWS Cloud Formation.

> In this workshop we are going to use TypeScript and JavaScript as our
> programming language, but the AWS CDK is currently supported in JavaScript,
> TypeScript, Java and .NET and more languages are coming up.

So what are we going to build? Nothing too fancy... We'll spend some time
to setup your environment and learn a little about how to work with the CDK.

Then, you'll write a little "Hello, world" Lambda function and front it with a
API Gateway.

Next, we'll introduce the very powerful concept of __CDK constructs__.
Constructs allow you to bundle up a bunch of infrastructure into a reusable
component which anyone can compose into their apps. We'll walk you through
writing your own construct, and then you'll add to your stack a construct
someone else published to npmjs.

By the end of this workshop, we hope you'll be able to:

👍 Create new CDK applications.<br/>
👍 Define your app's infrastructure using the AWS Construct Library<br/>
👍 Deploy your CDK apps to your AWS account<br/>
👍 Define your own reusable constructs<br/>
👍 Consume constructs published by other people<br/>
