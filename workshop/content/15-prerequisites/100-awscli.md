The AWS CLI allows you to interact with AWS services from your command line.
Make sure you have the latest version of the AWS CLI installed on your system.

If you already have pip and a supported version of Python, you can install the
AWS CLI with the following command:

```s
$ pip install awscli --upgrade --user
```

You can go to the [AWS Command Line Interface
installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)
page or use one of the following quick links:
