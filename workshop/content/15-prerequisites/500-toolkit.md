Next, we'll install the AWS CDK Toolkit. The toolkit is a command-line utility
which allows you to work with CDK apps.



Open a terminal session and run the following command:

```s
npm i -g aws-cdk
```

Depending on your system configuration, you may need to use `sudo` in order to
install globally:

```
sudo npm i -g aws-cdk
```

You can check the toolkit version:

```s
cdk --version
```

This workshop was tested using __v0.13.0__ of the AWS CDK.
